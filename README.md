##Friend_Z0ne<br>

This is a Ruby on Rails Api that helps you meet new friends by creating events for people to participate in.

To install all the gems in this app run ```bundle install``` in your terminal, <br> this should add all the gems to your system uncluding RSpec<br>
Next run ```rails db:create```<br>
Then ```rails db:migrate```<br> In the terminal to create and migrate the databases.

##Running the tests<br>

```rspec``` in terminal should run all the tests included into the code<br>

Many tests should run<br>
These tests check many features within app including...<br>

* a user can join an event that has been created<br>
* a user can view all events<br>
